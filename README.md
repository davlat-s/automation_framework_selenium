# automation_framework_selenium

I started this project to get a deeper understanding of how automation frameworks are built. I'm building a test framework for a simple practise web page with the design of the framework as the main focus. The tools I decided to go with are: Python as the language, Selenium Webdriver as the browser automation framework, Pytest as the testing framework and HTML for the report display. This framwork was built using the Page Object Model design pattern.
